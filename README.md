## **Business Understanding**

When a borrower comes and ask for a loan to a Lending Company, it's up for the company to either **accept** or **reject** the loan. They decide that based on the borrower's profile. 
- If the borrower's profile is **bad** and the company lended their money to them, it will results in a financial loss for the company
- If the borrower's profile is **good** and the company didn't lend their money to them, it will also results in a financial loss for the company

**TARGET** : Borrower's profile **good**, company **accept** the loan

When a borrower's loan is **accepted** there will be 3 possible scenarios that happen to them
1. **Fully Paid** : Borrower fully paid all the amount they loaned
2. **Current** : Borrower still in their tenure
3. **Charged Off** : Borrower failed to fully paid all the amount they loaned after the **default** period

## **Our Objectives**

Make a Predictive Model to assist lending companies in their decision making to either **accept** or **reject** a loan, in hope to reduce error and increase company profits
